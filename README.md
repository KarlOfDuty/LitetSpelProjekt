# LitetSpelProjekt
A BTH second year small game project.

The requirements appear to have been deleted on the university's website so I cannot quote them here.

The requirements included for instance creating our own game engine, using animation, a number of rendering techniques and to make the very short game complete in content. The content completeness meant that the game should have a start and end and should feel like it isn't missing things like enemies or other things to engage with along the way.

The game includes our own basic OpenGL engine, our own maps and models, characters with animation, simple enemies, and several playable characters. We developed it in one month with 6 develpoers, two technical artists and four game programmers.
